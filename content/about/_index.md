**[Radovan Bast](https://bast.fr)** is a research software engineer with
background in theoretical chemistry. He's worked in France, Stockholm, and now
Tromsø at the border between science, software, and computational support and
enjoys supporting multi-disciplinary research. He now works as part of
[Norwegian Research Infrastructure Services](https://documentation.sigma2.no/)
at the University of Tromsø (UiT), and leads the
[CodeRefinery](https://coderefinery.org) project. At UiT he leads the
high-performance computing group and the research software engineering group.
These days mostly programming in Python, Rust, R, and JavaScript but has spent
many years with Fortran, C(++), and CMake.

**Magnar Bjørgve** has a background in applied mathematics and theoretical chemistry.
He is working in the GPU and training team at [NRIS](https://documentation.sigma2.no/)
at the University of Tromsø, Norway.

**Jørn Dietze** is almost finished with a Ph.D in bioinformatics.
He is working with high-performance computing systems and
has experience with programming in Python, Julia, and a little bit of C.
He is part of [NRIS](https://documentation.sigma2.no/)
at the University of Tromsø, Norway, and the
[LUMI User Support Team](https://www.lumi-supercomputer.eu/).

## Former group members

**Bente Barge** is a Ph.D student in computational chemistry and part-time
member of the HPC group at the University of Tromsø, Norway. Coding has been an
important part of her Ph.D and her interest in research software development
has evolved during her time in academia.
