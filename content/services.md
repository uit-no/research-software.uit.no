    Ask questions and get help from RSE engineers at the UiT Library - 2 hours on (almost) every Wednesday.

    _Cost_: Free on a first-come, first-serve basis.

- __Individual Consultations__:
    Schedule one-on-one meetings with an RSE engineer for personalized assistance with your projects. An initial free consultation is offered to help us understand how we can best meet your specific needs. We can then arrange subsequent times to work with you on your project.

    _Cost_: Initial consultation free; afterwards the cost is 600 kr/hr (5-hour minimum).

- __Extended Collaborations__:
    For longer lasting projects, you can contract for either part-time or full-time involvment of Research Software Engineers.

    _Cost_: Ideally, contact the RSE group at the grant proposal stage so that the RSE engineer's salary can be costed directly into your grant application. Alternatively, we can provide our services at a rate of 600 kr/hr.
