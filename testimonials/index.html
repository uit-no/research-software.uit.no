<p>"The Research Software Engineering Group has been of great help to me in
starting to use Git and organizing my code. I joined the Code Refinery
workshops, which provided a good introduction to Git. In the time that
followed, the RSE group was available to answer Git-related questions,
making it easier for me to apply Git to my own research work. The RSE group
also introduced me to tools like Black, Flake8, and docstring guides for
cleaning up code, as well as creating top-level functions in scripts and
importing functions via symlink. The sessions have been a combination of
in-person help and group discussions, both of which have worked out well.
The group is always welcoming and eager to help with any problems you may
have."</p>

<p>"I had approached the RSE group seeking help to improve the efficiency and
performance of my python code which was taking approximately 4 weeks to run
even when using 8 cores of a server.</p>
<p>The objective was to go through 8 years of data stored in approximately
18000 txt files and extract certain parameters based on a set of given
conditions. Even though I had used python before, I got the opportunity to
learn about new functionalities and features of pandas dataframes.  Using
Black and other extensions, I was taught to organize my code more
efficiently thereby improving its readability. Additionally, Radovan also
showed me that is possible to import my own functions as separate modules
without the need to populate my script with a lot of functions. These were
so powerful that the execution time for the script slid down <strong>from 4 weeks
to below an hour</strong> which was really cool!</p>
<p>Radovan also motivated me to use GitHub, which I had never used before, by
introducing features that could be utilized by a research student like me
who uses a lot of data and scripts. I am starting to explore more features
of GitHub and python on my own now. I am really happy with the guidance I
had received from the RSE group especially that from Radovan who helped me
re-think the way I program. I felt that the RSE group members are so
welcoming and excited to help learn and relearn new things together."</p>

<p>"As an environmental chemist, I’ve spent years working with a large research
code written in Visual Basic 6 (VB6). My programming skills have been limited
to trial and error in VB6. When we finally decided to translate our code from
VB6 to Python for long-term sustainability, I came across RSE by coincidence.
At that point, I had no idea where to start learning Python or how to approach
the code effectively. I was uncertain about how much assistance RSE could
provide for this daunting task.</p>
<p>However, my experience with RSE turned out to be incredibly positive. From the
outset, they were approachable, friendly, and helpful. They patiently guided me
through Python basics and introduced me to essential tools like docstring
guidelines, testing, pylint, black, profiling and git. While I did most of the
programming myself, they provided strategic advice on code architecture and
structure, covering both simple concepts and more intricate ones. Most
importantly, they introduced me to a programming mindset—how to think when
designing code, what to prioritize, and the importance of principles like DRY
code, code smells, and classes screaming to get out.</p>
<p>From dealing with a massive spaghetti codebase in VB6 – once so convoluted that
I had to print it out on paper to trace loops and connections, I now have a
more robust, flexible, sustainable and modern codebase in an object-oriented
design.</p>
<p>Collaborating with RSE opened up a whole new world for me. I learned things I
wish I’d known a decade ago. Not only did they assist with the challenging task
of porting my code from VB6 to Python, but they also helped me become a better,
more independent programmer. It felt like having a personal programming
coach—one who not only knows the technical aspects but can also communicate
effectively with non-programmers. Their patience in addressing my questions and
mistakes was invaluable. I doubt I would have found anyone else who could have
helped me with the same enthusiasm and dedication as RSE.</p>
<p>The collaboration with the RSE team transformed the porting process into an
enjoyable, fun and rewarding experience. I can’t praise them enough, especially
Jørn, whom I met with regularly for almost a year. I’m forever grateful for
everything he taught (and continues to teach) me. I sincerely hope our
collaboration continues, and if you’re considering reaching out to them, don’t
hesitate—just do it. And bring cookies!"</p>

<p>I've been working with and am still working with open sourcing of a Fortran
source code which would be near impossible without the software engineering
support group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have been using the online cluster to run my OpenFOAM simulations for my
PhD research, and I couldn't be happier with the support provided.
The support team is knowledgeable and responsive, always ready to help me
navigate through any challenges I face.  I highly recommend this service to
any researcher looking for reliable and efficient computational resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great support. Saved me weeks and weeks of time. Super
helpful and friendly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RSE helped me adapt my analysis to run on the HPC computing cluster at UiT.
This cut the time to run my analysis from many days down to hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I got help from the RSE Group structuring my code, which has been very
helpful for the specific project, but also for future projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The RSE group members are really smart and innovative when it comes to coding
and they’re able to communicate these solutions and the reasoning behind them
in a way that makes sense for me so that I can apply it in my future coding
activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The RSE team made an incredible effort to both understand my problem, and
explain possible solutions to it in a way that I (as a relatively
non-technical person) could understand. When I contacted RSE, I was trying to
estimate a model with Bayesian estimation techniques on highly skewed data.
The code took forever to run, and locked up my computer. I couldn't work on
anything else for several hours (sometimes days) when I ran the code. The
analysis was exploratory, meaning that I had to run several versions of the
model to find the right one. With the help from RSE, I found a way to speed
up the code to just a few minutes. This enabled me to trouble shoot the model
and move forward in my analysis. Without them, I would not have been able to
finish the analysis! Thanks a million!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The support offered by the research and software engineering team at UiT is
immensely useful to anyone who wants to integrate coding into their research.
Direct access to knowledgeable people allows for quick and personal
assistance that helped me turn an idea into reality.  In my case, the support
was focused on optimizing code and as a result I was able to generate results
within minutes instead of hours.</p>
